      "Police allege Charles McKenzie Ross Evans, 44, murdered Alicia Little, 41, by hitting her with a car out the front of her rural home in Kyneton on December 28.\n",
      "Mr Evans was arrested and charged with a single count of murder following Ms Little’s death.\n",
      "Several of Ms Little's family and friends were in Bendigo on Tuesday morning to see Mr Evans face court.\n",
      "Detective acting Sergeant Leigh Smyth told the Melbourne Magistrates Court last week, police went to the Lavenders Lane property about 3.45pm following reports of a \"domestic violence incident\".\n",
      "The court also heard Ms Little called police for help but when they arrived they found her unconscious in the front yard of her home.\n",
      "Paramedics attempted to revive her but she died at the scene.\n",
      "Police allege an autopsy conducted revealed Ms Little died of blunt force trauma consistent with being struck by a motor vehicle.\n",
      "Police will also allege Mr Evans allegedly fled the scene after hitting Ms Little with a car but returned hours later at 5.30pm.\n",
      "Mr Evans told the court in his first appearance last week he had \"never been in trouble before\".\n",
      "\"I don't know what to do,\" he said. \"I spoke to a solicitor on the phone. I wanted to speak about everything but my solicitor told me to hold off.\"\n",
      "The Kyneton man made no application for bail in his brief appearance on Tuesday and was remanded in custody pending a committal mention in Bendigo on May 16.\n",
      "Alicia Little was allegedly murdered outside her home in Kyneton.\n",
      "Friends took to social media to post emotional tributes to Ms Little in the hours after her death remembering her as a \"loving, infectious and intelligent\" woman.\n",
      "\"You always had a big smile on your face always happy and fun you made everyone around you feel so loved and happy,\" friend Sheldon Grant wrote.\n",
      "\"Whenever I was upset you always made me smile, you were my mum away from my mum.\"\n",
      "Friend Kelly Maynard described her death as \"gut wrenching and heartbreaking.\"\n",
      "\"She was an easy person to love, always smiling, always up for a joke or prank, genuinely funny and yet also so intelligent and caring to talk to,\" she posted.\n",
      "Another friend said \"she was just so infectious to be around, could never get enough of how beautiful a person she was.\"\n",

      "Nelly Yoa's heartfelt and thoughtful article (The Age, 2/1) about the South Sudanese deserves wide support. He speaks with inside knowledge and he wisely recommends open discussion of this delicate problem. This calls for balanced thinking without resort to ethnic stereotypes. Violence associated with particular ethnic groups is, of course, a serious problem and it must be confronted, but we would do well to recall that gang violence has also previously occurred disproportionately in other groups and is still doing so.\n",
      "I have done extensive research into the integration of immigrants. I recall the outcry 50years ago about the high rate of delinquency in immigrant families from Britain, for example. In most cases, youths who participate in these gangs are trying to achieve some level of self-esteem, and violence is the way they know best to achieve it.\n",
      "Yoa suggests five constructive solutions, but much more is needed. The authorities need to use the advice of criminologists, social workers and psychologists, and to co-operate with community leaders. However, solutions are not easy and, in some cases, impossible. If a youth has the ability to behave appropriately as a member of a gang, there is some possibility of finding more acceptable alternatives for him than engaging in gang violence. It is a very difficult task for the police and other authorities to find answers, and it requires high levels of  imagination, enterprise and patience. Above all, it requires adequate funding.\n",
      "I am sick of the excuses being made for the behaviour of Sudanese youth gangs. There has been a shifting of blame away from them, and the damage they have done, and onto the community for not doing more to support them. We all have problems, whether it is unemployment, poverty, domestic violence, poor health, homelessness, addiction or mental illness. This does not result in masses of people engaging in criminal and anti-social behaviour.\n",
      "Similarly, it does not excuse the criminal and anti-social behaviour of some Sudanese youth. Our society does not owe anyone a living. The world and life is what we each make of it. Many Sudanese people from under-privileged and damaged backgrounds have come here, but the majority have assimilated and become valued members of society. Those Sudanese youth who spit in the face of the opportunity for a new life in Australia, and who run amok, disrespecting and abusing our society, should face the full force of the law. After serving their penalty, they should be deported to Sudan. Let them assess where the quality of life is better.\n",
      "What a refreshing change to read Nelly Yoa's take on African youth gangs. No political correctness, denial or \"twisted\" statistics. His five  solutions are strategic and practical. Consider how long it has taken government and police representatives to accept a problem exists – and still only in language that continues to misdirect and confuse. Yoa's reference to things like arts and sports as leverage to teach peace building skills are spot on. I would add music to that list.\n",
      "Governments and the police should forget about forming more committees and task forces. Instead, cut the bureaucracy and appoint someone like a former commissioner for children and young people to allocate resources to implement, monitor and report on alternatives, such as Yoa's, that are grounded in reality. His suggestions may not be a magic cure, but they are a good start. A prerequisite for funding would be the ability to meet achievable and sustainable outcomes.\n",
      "The sudden realisation by Victoria Police that there are, indeed, Sudanese gangs in Melbourne is disturbing at best. Only last week they denied it and admonished the media for suggesting it. Did these gangs spontaneously appear? Or, more likely, were the police being dishonest? Their role is to enforce the law, not act as public relations agents for criminals.\n",
      "As a former director of strategic planning and policy with the Police Ministry, I lament the inaction of both sides of politics to prevent the development of criminality among young people. The African street gang issue highlights the capacity for governments to turn crime into a political football rather than adopt a targeted intervention to address both the criminal acts and the cause of crime. Funds have been diverted from prevention and social support efforts to shore up the \"tough on crime approach\" in order to win elections.\n",
      "Research shows there are real benefits in developing a long-term, multi-agency strategy. This would focus on intensive interventions to engage children, families and vulnerable at-risk groups. We cannot \"arrest our way\" out of some social problems and it is not fair to put the blame on police or the government in power.\n",
      "One of the most disappointing aspects of the violence in Tarneit is local MP Telmo Languiller's silence. Is it too much to ask that he come to his electorate to support his constituents?\n",
      "Kate Habgood's article – \"Primitive view of Africa is part of the problem\" (Comment, 3/1) – should be compulsory reading for politicians, police officers, pedagogues and the public. Pray heed the voice of knowledge and compassion.\n",
      "Without denying the crimes committed by young African people, I believe that any approach which singles them out as the menacing face of crime in general will only make the problem worse.\n",
      "Nelly Yoa provides some useful, if hardly new, ideas. However, his \"if I can do it, you should be able to do it too\" attitude, and his rhetoric of condemnation, demonise his community's youth. This carries the risk that he will be leapt upon by \"tough on crime\" zealots who are keen to target Sudanese youth.\n",
      "They seek political advantage by exploiting fear, rather than offering evidence-based solutions to prevent crime. We can now count in this camp a frothing state opposition and an opportunistic Prime Minister grasping at straws for his own survival.\n",
      "The Andrews government is making some progress on youth crime. However, it needs to stand up more strongly against a damaging \"law-and-order auction\" by fixing a broken youth justice system and turning away from \"supermax\" prisons for children that further entrench them in the justice system.\n",

      "Former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer has accused the United States of perpetrating a \"diplomatic insult\" to Australia by failing to appoint an ambassador in Canberra for nearly 18 months (The Age, 3/1). Surely he understands that the US does not require an ambassador here because our leaders ensure that Australia is, in fact, its 51st state.\n",
      "I am appalled that some politicians and bureaucrats are worried the revelation of Alexander Downer's involvement in alerting the FBI about Russian interference in the US election might disturb Australia's relationship with the US. In fact, the US/Australian alliance should be under scrutiny.\n",
      "An alliance which has dragged us into wars where we should never have been, such as Vietnam and Iraq; voting against good proposals at the UN to curry favour with the US, making us an international embarrassment; and the long delay in appointing a US ambassador (a studied insult). These and other issues are surely reasons to quit the alliance. Australia must have an independent foreign policy which serves our interests, and not those of the US.\n",
      "Just when many thought the proposal for a republic was dead, buried and cremated, it has made a come back (The Age, 2/1).

      "While China has implemented its one belt, one road international economic and political strategy, Australia is fixated on internal political squabbles and power games. These self-serving manoeuvres have become the nation's targets but are detrimental to our security.\n",

      "In 2017, duck shooters killed rare and threatened species and, it seems, no one has been held accountable. This \"sport\" is a law and order issue, as well as an animal welfare issue. Revised hunting codes of practice will do little for the native ducks left wounded and littered around our state. New codes will still be unenforceable. Why do governments pander to the tiny 0.4per cent of Victorians who are responsible for this suffering?\n",
      "An idea – and, indeed, a challenge – for all those (wowsers?) bemoaning the cost of New Year's Eve fireworks. Show the way by first imposing a ban on your own expenditure on cakes, cards, candles, gift wrapping, flowers, wine and other associated floss and tinsel typically incurred in \"celebrations\" within your households. By all means donate the combined savings to better causes of your choosing. The few million dollars blown up in Melbourne on New Year's Eve would be small change in comparison.\n",
      "It is great that ASX 100 chief information officers support actions to improve young women's participation in the technology sector (BusinessDay, 2/1). However, making maths compulsory is an idea that has been around for decades. The participation problem is a post-year 10 issue, particularly in the more advanced subjects. The re-introduction of pre-requisites for a host of degrees would have a profound effect. \"Making maths fun\" is another favourite idea.\n",
      "The BHP Billiton Foundation's Choose Maths program, delivered by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute, is a great example of what can be done to address relevance and career possibilities.\n",
      "The glaring hole is a program that addresses the teaching issue. Post-year 10 participation and students' engagement with maths depends on teacher quality. It is a national disgrace that many primary teachers have little idea of what they are teaching and out-of-field teaching is rife in secondary schools. A question to the CIOs: successive governments have failed to act on maths teacher quality. What can you do?\n",
      "Retiring CIO of Tabcorp Kim Wenn's suggestion to make the STEM field (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) more attractive to girls is both right and wrong. It would be far better to make these subjects more appealing to all students at primary and secondary levels. Why differentiate? More positive approaches to STEM will augur well for the future of all.\n",

      "Indigenous artist, educator and curator Paola Balla does not identify as a feminist. \"Feminism has failed us, as it was not designed for us. I say this with awareness that I am a co-curator of a show about art and feminism, and stand in my black matriarchal knowing and doing this work ... Our shared sisterhood does not make us sisters with white women.\"\n",
      "She says she's not alone in this, that many Aboriginal women are critical of white liberal feminism. \"There's a problematic history that we can't untangle our race from our gender. That's not something that white women have to deal with. So ... gender doesn't trump race, particularly not in 2017. It's the ongoing unfinished business for Aboriginal women, we constantly have to assert that our lives matter. I can't really talk about feminist ideals until that work is done. People talk about reaching glass ceilings etc – that's for a very small, select group of middle class women ...\"\n",
      "Even so, Balla is one of the team involved in ACCA's exhibition devoted to feminism and art. It's a huge show, the brainchild of ACCA head Max Delany and curator Annika Kristensen, together with a team including Balla, Julie Ewington, Elvis Richardson and Vikki McInnis.\n",
      "Recognising the ongoing nature of feminism, the show is called Unfinished Business. Given domestic violence affects one in three women, sexual harassment charges against men in power are rife and women around the world continue to be paid about a third less than their male equivalents, it's clear there's a long way to go.\n",
      "Balla says while she is a passionate advocate for women's work, and appreciated the invitation to be involved with the show, she was a little reluctant. \"I was cautious about stepping into a very particular paradigm, but I also wanted to make sure there was an Aboriginal voice at that curatorial table.\"\n",
      "She points to the fact that Aboriginal women face 34 times the amount of violence white women do. Several works featured in the show reflect her and many other Indigenous artists' concerns. Artist Ali Gumillya Baker's work Racist Texts, 2014/17, is completely composed of racist books – everything from picture books featuring Aboriginal kids from history through to current texts. She has positioned them in such a way that  reinforces just how many there are – it towers above the ground, eight metres high. Baker argues these works have infiltrated the way people think about Aboriginal people.\n",
      "\"The legacy of these books lives on in people's memories and thoughts,\" Balla says. \"This is just a tiny amount of them. It's quite an alarming work, it's shocking.\"\n",
      "Another is Fiona Foley's work Black Velvet, 1996,  a reference to a euphemism used by white men for black women in Australia. Foley says she asked herself what that would look like, so she made up her own iconography, which consists of 12 cloth dilly bags sewn with red vulvas.\n",
      "The feminist movement changed the art world irrevocably. First and foremost, it challenged the notion that only men could be artists. It seems almost inconceivable now but it was not until the 1970s that women's art was regularly featured in solo exhibitions at galleries and museums; their smaller shows were rarely reviewed or they did not rate a mention on school curriculums.\n",
      "\"That has changed enormously so that today some of the most celebrated artists in Australia are not white, straight men,\" art critic and curator Ewington says. \"They are folk of all persuasions and colours and that is enormously different.\"\n",
      "Max Delany, head of the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art.\n",
      "In many ways, 1975 was a pivotal year. Designated the International Year of Women, it saw American feminist, critic and activist Lucy Lippard tour Australia, contributing to debate and discussion and spurring on the nascent movement. It also saw the establishment of the Women's Art Register in Melbourne.  Art historian and author Janine Burke curated Australian women artists, 100 years: 1840-1940 for the Ewing and George Galleries at Melbourne University, which then travelled interstate;  it later became a seminal book.  1976 saw the launch of Lip magazine, a significant journal of feminist art.\n",
      "Inspired by the idea of revisiting feminism and art about 40 years on,  Delany says the show focuses on present and contemporary art but it also includes historical references and touchpoints. To his mind, the title suggests both intergenerational dialogue and the passing of the baton from one generation to the next.\n",
      "\"A lot of artists are delving back into the archives and drawing upon those histories to activate them again or bring them differently in the present,\" he says.\n",
      "Delany argues it is critical the exhibition features multiple voices and is intergenerational. \"Feminism now intersects with a whole lot of other contexts – gender, age, race and ethnicity ...  as much as anything [it] is a form of activism in that it seeks social change and transformation,\" he says.\n",
      "The feminist movement in Australia in the 1970s started a new conversation across society and its impact was seismic. According to Ewington, it was a fascinating time to be an Australian woman and indeed to be an artist. Women turned their hand to everything from protest posters to sit-ins and banners on behalf of social causes such as domestic violence. \"In time, artists were also thinking not only of the necessity for legislative change but about how to be an artist in the world and how to picture women – whether in paintings or in film or in photography or writing or play writing – so it was enormously energetic and productive and interesting.\"\n",
      "The feminist art movement changed what was featured in art. It saw a greater focus on the self, female experiences of the body (menstruation, childbirth, aging and sex), the domestic and the lived experience of femininity (growing up female, marriage, motherhood , family etc). Different forms emerged and flourished, especially photography, performance art, and film. Murals were created collaboratively, challenging traditional ideas about authorship. Activist work, comprising posters and placards, emerged as an art form and allowed a more democratic distribution of works.\n",
      "Ewington says there has been significant progress since 1975. \"The young women seem to have inherited a sense of confidence and expectation that I think was much more fragile in the '60s and '70s,\" she says. \"We've seen over my lifetime the success of women in a variety of roles. We never saw them before. A lot of those firsts have been achieved and this has a cumulative effect on the confidence, the expectation and the ability to act of these younger women. It's absolutely fundamental; it's really as simple as 'If she can do it, I can do it.' \"\n",
      "That sort of role modelling is critical, but even so, the discrepancies between how many men have shows and what they earn compared with their female counterparts are significant. \"When you do the counting, as Elvis Richardson does through her CoUNTESS project, you still come up against a numerical ceiling of about one-third of women being present in major shows or gallery surveys or even less likely in major solo shows,\" Ewington says. \"Those things are changing slowly; what we're looking at is a really broad societal change. And these conversations are very, very long.\"\n",
      "Ewington is a fan of Brisbane-artist Kelly Doley's work in the show, Things I have learnt about feminism, 2014. Commissioned for a show at Boxcopy, a collective of emerging artists, the work features a series of what look like fluoro posters. Doley has taken all sorts of old slogans and jokes from the feminist movement and she's asking questions.\n",
      "\"It's an absolute ripsnorter cos it's got all these different texts. One of the great things about this work, which is funny and provocative at the same time, is it tackles head on the idea that feminism is contradictory.\"\n",
      "She says Doley's piece is lighthearted and sophisticated. \"The work says there is a lot of room in this space for differences of opinion and many of these issues are not yet resolved or they're resolved in different times and places. It's opening up rather than closing down. That's really crucial.\"\n",
      "Artist Sarah Goffman's work I am with you 2017 quotes from placards at the women's protest marches after the election of Donald Trump earlier this year. Echoing the thoughts of millions of women around the world, one of them is, \"I can't believe we're still arguing this shit\".\n",
      "Delany says I am with you reflects the polyphonic nature of the exhibition. \"While there's no shortage of humour in those texts or in those sentiments, [there's] also a great seriousness.\"\n",
      "So, having seen how the world has changed since the 1970s, does Ewington feel hopeful about where we're heading?\n",
      "\"It's up to us to make our own lives, it's up to us  ...  to find tactics that will take us around resistance to what is just and generous and worth doing in life. So the answer is always, hugely hopeful. I have huge faith in the intelligence and thoughtfulness and power of imagination of women and men.\"\n",

      "Counter to Catherine Walsh's assertion that volunteering just props up a broken system or \"signals that you are a good person\" (Comment, 5/1) , I have found it to be a life-changing and principled thing to do.  I am a foster carer and took a young boy into our home many years ago; he is part of our family now. There is no way his life outcomes would have been as positive if he had been put into situation where people were employed to raise him. Also, he would have cost the state even more money.\n",
      "Additionally, he is now 18 and has a wonderful volunteer teaching him to drive through VicRoads' L2P program. This man offers his time, guidance and experience to help our child gain his licence. Lastly, the enjoyment and human connections that I have made through parenting this wonderful young man have been immeasurable. I would do it all again in a heartbeat. I challenge Catherine Walsh to consider the increased human capital built while  engaging in volunteerism as a legitimate and worthwhile activity that has benefits far beyond \"fixing broken systems\".\n",
      "Yes, Catherine Walsh is right, the system is broken and we are propping it up. However, as a volunteer with St Vincent de Paul, I know that we would love to solve the problem and put ourselves out of business. While we are waiting for our constant letters and calls to MPs and councils to take effect, do we leave the young woman fleeing domestic violence without a bed? Do we leave the chap made redundant without food because he is not yet eligible for Newstart? Do we let the family be evicted because they are behind with their rent after a complicated medical issue? Do we let people on Newstart have their gas or electricity disconnected because they have $100 a fortnight to live on after they have paid their rent?\n",
      "We are talking about human crises which, in many cases, would end in tragedy without our help. Please, Catherine Walsh, think before you denigrate volunteers. Meanwhile we will keep writing letters.\n",
      "Catherine Walsh's generalisations are a sad assessment of the value of community. There will never be enough money to support every need or fix all systems, and there are more varied hands-on tasks than just selling chocolates or cakes. I list my occupation as \"volunteer\" as I am lucky to work in organisations that make the world a better place.\n",
      "As a former councillor, my major learning was the extent to which our communities depend on volunteers – from organisations that provide emergency, sporting or personal services for less fortunate people through to individual parenting. Without volunteers, our society would not exist in its present form. Incidentally, not-for-profit entities that apply accounting standards are now required to book voluntary labour as income in their accounts. So we are at least starting to recognise the monetary value of this important asset.\n",
      "Catherine Walsh's idea to replace volunteers with government action is appalling. Volunteering is personal involvement and commitment. It says we are a society and that not all transactions are economic ones. Contracting out our human endeavours to bureaucracy is to deny personal responsibility and demand that \"they\" do something about \"it\", even though \"they\" may  be overburdened meeting the demands of the middle-class whingers who dominate electoral politics. The Christian injunction is \"love thy neighbour as thyself\", not \"tell the government to love thy neighbour because thee are too lazy to get out of thy chair\".\n",
      "Does Peter Dutton know who he is talking about when he vilifies the Sudanese people? Having worked in Darfour – and seen displaced families living in camps with only a sheet of plastic to shelter them from the cruel heat, children lining up for hours to get the minimal amount of water needed for their parents to share out, and children dying from malnutrition – I have a different view.\n",
      "Mr Dutton, I dare you to you spend even a week under plastic in one of these camps before you continue your racist criticism regarding the behaviour of the luckiest of these Sudanese who have survived. Would you be running out cheerfully to greet the white aid workers who have everything, and who can pack up and return to luxury, or would you be frightened to leave your plastic at night because you decided your neighbour's skin was darker than yours?\n",
      "I work in   a community-based setting with young people, many of African descent. We need to focus on the systemic racism experienced by this group – racial profiling, unfair treatment, exclusion in educational and employment settings  – rather than scapegoating communities and perpetuating divisiveness.\n",
      "As a colonised nation, Australia has a poor track record and immense discomfort with recognising and addressing such areas. Until we peel back the layers, it is impossible to achieve fair and equitable outcomes for all Australians. Fearmongering is a common tactic deployed in election campaigns. Let us not succumb to such gross and simplistic representations.\n",
      "As a South African immigrant to Australia, it is with a sore heart that I am witness to Peter Dutton's racism. There is no doubt there are violent criminals who emanate from Sudanese and Somalian communities, and they should be prosecuted with the full might of the law. There is no excuse for thuggery, regardless of your background or circumstance.\n",
      "That said, violent criminals emanate from all communities. The way to deal with this is to focus on the thugs, work positively with the communities –  who, generally, are victims of the thuggery themselves – and refrain from racist political posturing. Gangs of predominantly Sudanese/Somalian youth are not criminals because their parents came from Somalia/Sudan.\n",
      "It really is a poor state of affairs when politicians feel the need to rule with fear and divisive language. If Peter Dutton were standing by the water cooler in any workplace spouting this crap, would be hauled straight into the HR department.\n",
      "So tell me, why is it acceptable in politics? If the only way you can gather a few more votes is by inciting fear, Peter Dutton, you are  in trouble. Oh, wait, don't tell me you actually believe this stuff? I feel an election landslide coming on.\n",
      "In my area, white-skinned people have been showing how they feel about stupid remarks by Peter Dutton and Malcolm Turnbull  by eating out at local Somali, Ethiopian and Abyssinian cafes, to the extent that we had to queue outside our favourite one this week. Nobody seemed to be scared.\n",
      "Peter Dutton, in the next 10 days, I will be out for dinner in three different suburbs, will have coffee in another suburb and will go to the theatre in the city – all by public transport and walking. You need to get out more, like Melburnians are doing, without fear, every day.\n",
      "Of course, \"more crime is committed in Victoria by Australian-born and \"white\" offenders\", Katharine Spencer (Letters, 3/1). This is because there are far fewer African youths in Victoria. However, what is relevant is that \"people of Sudanese backgrounds are over-represented in crime statistics\" (The Age, 5/1).\n",
      "It is ironic that when MPs cannot really subscribe to Pauline Hanson's racist rhetoric, they do the next best thing: bleat on about race violence on our streets. Odd, though. I frequently travel, as do my friends, on public transport, and walk the streets and eat in cafes on my own. No Africans have rushed in and threatened to smash up the places. We have had one attempted break-in to our property in 33 years and we saw the perpetrators: young white males.\n",
      "This is an attempt to stitch-up the Victorian government, but why? Is it because it is doing something to assist its citizens? Dreadful things like removing railway crossings, building schools, introducing assisted dying laws and community inclusivity programmes. Enough  self-righteous rage, Peter Dutton. Just get on with real governance.\n",
      "The Prime Minister knows xenophobia is endemic in the community. Like his predecessors, John Howard and Tony Abbott, he also knows  if you press the right buttons, you can change xenophobia into outright racism and gain a huge advantage at the ballot box. Hence his pressing these buttons during the Bennelong byelection with respect to asylum seekers on Manus, and now with respect to the Sudanese community in Melbourne.\n",
      "For several years, thinking Australians have vainly pined for some good federal government, as the polls attest. Now, Peter Dutton, stepping outside of both his areas of responsibility and enlightened knowledge, brings their hopes crashing down yet again. The term politician has become a pejorative description. We crave statesmen but, regrettably, we keep getting politicians.\n",
      "Mr Dutton's comments, with no intent but to harm the image of a state government he does not like, have the additional effect of increasing the very fear that he cites. There is certainly a need for effective action against the gangs he alludes to, and the evidence is that progress is being made. But his formula is to make young criminals into hardened recidivist ones. I swear that he frightens me.\n",
      "This weak state government has known about the rise of African gangs for several years, and has done little. As soon as Malcolm Turnbull jumps in, all of a sudden there is a problem and Police Minister Lisa Neville know how to fix it. The inhumane actions of this government with this issue, and others, is the only thing it will be remembered for.\n",
      "It is outrageous that the state government failed to consult with Melbourne City Council (other than Councillor Robert Doyle) or the community before signing off on the gross commercialisation of our primary gathering space (The Age, 5/1). The Apple store will overwhelm the civic and cultural use of Federation Square, which was always to be its primary intent. We can only hope that the state government acknowledges the broad community concern and abandons the deal.\n",
      "The shortest definition of democracy is \"a system of government by the whole population\". Yet 77,000 residents who have signed online petitions opposing the Apple development in Federation Square are being ignored. Our lot as lowly citizens is relegated to paying ever-increasing rates and taxes, and putting up with what the \"government\" decides to do. Moreover, developments are now notoriously planned in secret and presented to the community as a fait accompli.\n",
      "While we spend months in frustrating planning procedures for minor alterations to our properties, the \"government\" is exempt from such mundane requirements. When in this instance even the Planning Minister remains unheard, the mind boggles.\n",
      "Michael Wolff's fascinating new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, is filled with \"false and misleading accounts\", according to the White House press secretary. Well, aren't these just \"alternative facts\"?\n",
      "Perhaps while they are sailing off Sorrento, our corporate leaders could search for a moral compass. Calling for tax cuts when many companies pay no tax, and the average rate is close to 20per cent, may be legal but it is not moral. Where is the evidence for our tax rate being a disincentive for investment when income can be sent offshore and little, if any, tax paid here? Where is the evidence that the \"trickle down effect\" will reduce wealth and income inequality?\n",
